## New Prompts Created (Tier 1 + Tier 2)

### Tier 1: Critical Missing Pieces

1. **rebuttal.prompt.md** - Response to Reviewers
   - Point-by-point responses to peer review
   - Required for virtually every manuscript revision
   - Includes diplomatic disagreement guidance

2. **cover_letter.prompt.md** - Initial Submission Cover Letter  
   - Introduces manuscript to journal editor
   - Required by most journals
   - Often determines desk rejection vs. peer review

3. **outline.prompt.md** - Pre-Writing Planning
   - Bridges literature collection → manuscript writing
   - Saves 3-5x time in writing phase
   - Includes figure planning and literature mapping

### Tier 2: High-Value Additions

4. **supplementary.prompt.md** - Supplementary Materials
   - Extended methods, code, data documentation
   - Increasingly required by journals
   - Essential for reproducibility

5. **presubmission_check.prompt.md** - Final Quality Verification
   - 12 comprehensive checklist sections (150+ checks)
   - Prevents desk rejection for technical issues
   - Different from substantive peer review

6. **revision_letter.prompt.md** - Revision Cover Letter
   - Brief letter accompanying revised manuscript
   - Summarizes major changes (details in rebuttal)
   - Required by most journals

## Quick Start for Users

### For New Projects
1. Read [PROJECT_SETUP.md](PROJECT_SETUP.md) for field-specific setup
2. Create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in your paper workspace
3. Follow the 13-step workflow sequentially
4. Use the quick reference table in README for timing estimates

### For Existing Projects
1. Run `presubmission_check.prompt.md` on current manuscripts
2. Use `outline.prompt.md` to document existing structure
3. Organize supplementary materials with `supplementary.prompt.md`
4. Have `cover_letter.prompt.md` and `rebuttal.prompt.md` ready for next submission

### When to Use Each New Prompt

| Prompt | Use When | Output | Time |
|--------|----------|--------|------|
| outline | After literature collection | Manuscript blueprint | 2-3 days |
| supplementary | After main draft | Extended materials | 3-5 days |
| presubmission_check | Before any submission | Quality report | 1-2 hours |
| cover_letter | Initial submission | Submission letter | 1-2 hours |
| rebuttal | After receiving reviews | Point-by-point response | 1-3 days |
| revision_letter | Revision submission | Brief cover letter | 30-60 min |
